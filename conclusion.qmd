To conclude, the current level of accessibility to emergency centres and healthcare facilities in Derna City are notably insufficient. The majority of residential towns are located more than 2.5 km away from the nearest shelter and are fall outside the buffer service area. This is due to insufficient shelters near the Eastern and Western edges of the city, making residents vulnerable in the event of a heavier flood. The situation is aggravated by the current flooding extent, where many existing shelters are within the flooded area, restricting access. It also reduces the number of evacuation options and the time taken for residents within flooded areas to reach a safety area. Therefore, the need to have additional emergency shelters to mitigate potential disasters in the future is essential.
