    "text": "Libya has been facing severe urban flooding in recent years caused by climate change and political instability. This led to life threatening consequences of death and destruction in the country. For instance, the collapse of the Derna dam in 2023 caused thousands of deaths and irreversible damage to the infrastructures. This devastated the country socially and economically. As a result, the government decided to deploy some measures to prepare for future disasters and assist in recovery and relief.\nThrough this project, we aim to enhance Derna City’s preparedness and reducing its rescue time. This is done by mapping out the accessibility of residential areas to emergency centres and medical services. We hope to provide meaningful insights for minimising the impact of flood disasters on Derna City and propose recommendations for future disaster management planning."

Click on Close button to close Slope function dialog window.\nIn order to save the newly computed Slope layer, we need to GeoPackage it.\nRight click on the Slope layer click on Export select Save As…\n·  Make sure that the format is Geopackage and select the Browse button at the File Name\n·  When inside the Geopackage file, create a new 'Slope' file and click on the save button\n·  At the Layer input, indicate \"Slope\"\n·  At the CRS, click on the drop-down button and click on EPSG: 32634\n\nRemove the temporary Slope layer by doing the steps mentioned above.\n\n\n\n1.6 Adding Elevation and Slope level to Education Layer\nFirstly, we need to download a plugin. At the menu bar, select Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins…\n\nAt the search tab, search for 'Point sampling tool' and click on it\nAt the bottom right, click on Install Plugin\n\nAfter the plugin is installed, close the dialog window\n\n\nEnsure that only the education layer and slope raster layer are selected in the layers panel.\n\nSelect Plugins > Analyses > Point Sampling Tool\nIn the 'Layers with fields/bands to get values from:', scroll down till you see the slope raster layer\nClick on it\nAt the 'Output point vector layer', select on the Browse button\nHead to the GeoPackage folder and name the new file as 'Slope_education''\n\n\n\nA new point layer will be created\n\n\n\nRepeat the same process to integrate the slope degree into the point layer. Instead of using the education layer and elevation raster layer, use the Slope_education and elevation level layer. Name the new layer 'edu_slope_elevation_model'. After this, remove the Slope_education layer.\n\n\n1.7 Creating Slope and Elevation Category Field\nTo make it easier to visualise which education location is most optimal, we will be creating a 'Low', 'Mid' and 'High' category for both the slope and elevation category.\n\nFor the slope category:\n\n\nRight click on the 'edu_slope_elevation_model' layer > select Open Attribute Table > Open field calculator\n\n\n\nAt the Output field name, indicate: 'Slope Level'\nAt the Output field type, click on the drop down icon and indicate Text as the data type\nCopy and paste the following code into the expression input:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCASE\nWhen (“slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” >= 0 and  “slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” < 2.1) THEN ‘Low Slope’\nWhen (  “slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” >= 2.1 and  “slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” < 4.7) THEN ‘Low Slope’\nWhen (  “slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” >= 4.7) THEN ’Low Slope'\nEND\n\n\n\n\nClick on the OK button and a new field will be created.\n\nFor the elevation category:\n\nRepeat the same steps as the slope category\n\n\n\nChange the Output field name to 'Elevation'\nCopy and paste the following code into the expression input:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCASE\nWhen ( “elevation_raster_model”  >= 5 and   “elevation_raster_model”< 21) THEN ‘Low Elevation’\nWhen( “elevation_raster_model”  >= 21 and  “elevation_raster_model” < 52) THEN ‘Low Elevation’\nWhen ( “elevation_raster_model”  >= 52) THEN ‘Low Elevation’\nEND\n\n\n\nAfter creating both of the categories, we need to create a new category with both the elevation and slope category. This allows us to categorise the education centres according to which both slope and elevation at the same time.\n\nRepeat the same steps as the slope category\n\n\n\nChange the Output field name to 'Final Def'\nCopy and paste the following code into the expression input:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCASE\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Low Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Low Slope’) THEN ‘Low elevation/slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Low Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Mid Slope’) THEN ‘Low elevation, Mid slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Low Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘High Slope’) THEN ‘Low elevation, High slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Mid Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Low Slope’) THEN ‘Mid elevation, Low slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Mid Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Mid Slope’) THEN ‘Mid elevation/slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Mid Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘High Slope’) THEN ‘Mid elevation, High slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘High Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Low Slope’) THEN ‘High elevation, Low slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘High Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Mid Slope’) THEN ‘High elevation, Mid slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘High Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘High Slope’) THEN ‘High elevation/slope’\nWHEN \"Slope Level\" IS NULL THEN \"Elevation\"\nEND\n\n\n\nAfter creating the 3 new categories, we need to save these changes. On the top left of Attribute table window, click on the pencil icon and confirm the saved changes made.\n\n\n1.8 Creating A Derna City Layer That Excludes The Flooded Area\nWe need to create a new layer that excludes areas that are flooded. To do this we need both the flooded layer and derna city layer.\n\nSelect Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Symmetrical Differences…\nFor the input layer: Flood - s2_20230912_floodextent_derna\nOverlay layer: Derna_City\nFor both the layer, click on the Advanced options\nAt the Invalid feature filtering, click on the drop down and select 'Do not Filter (Better Performance', and click on the back button on the top left\n\n\n\nHere is how the dialog window should look like\n\n\n\nClick on the run button\nA new layer 'Symmetrical difference' will be created\nGeopackage this layer to save it.

    "text": "In conclusion, the current accessibility of emergency centres and healthcare facilities in Derna City is limited. Although residential towns on the Eastern and Western edges of Derna City experience low accessibility, their exposure to flooding impact is minimal as these areas are situated outside of the flood-prone zones and have higher elevation/slope levels.\nSince most residential towns are located within these areas, it can be suggested that most of Derna City’s residents are at a lower risk during such flooding events. However, with the worsening floods in Libya coupled with the lack of shelters, these areas will become increasingly vulnerable over time.\nIn the long term, it is recommended for the government to increase the quantity of emergency centres. It would be advisable to construct these centres in locations with elevated and slope terrain, with a preference for higher elevation, and ensuring accessibility to major residential areas. This is essential in minimising vulnerability during unprecedented flood events when access to emergency services is limited."

    "text": "Considerations\nThe decision making process for the Libyan government depends on its priorities. Given financial constraints and political debates, the government must decide which is more important in light of the worsening flooding conditions:\na) Implement more mitigation measures in higher flooding risk areas\nb) Implement more preventive measures in lower flooding risk areas\nThis is crucial to continue protecting residents who are currently not affected by the flood. Additionally, it ensure that residents who were displaced by the flood have better infrastructure to prevent it from occurring again.\nCurrently, there are residential towns and healthcare facilities that fall within the flooding extent. Hence, it is essential to relocate residents affected by the flood and repair the damaged infrastructure first. There could also be more underlying implications which we are unable to observe directly from the visual differences between the maps."

After this, remove the Slope_education layer.\n\n\n1.7 Creating Slope and Elevation Category Field\nTo make it easier to visualise which education location is most optimal, we will be creating a 'Low', 'Mid' and 'High' category for both the slope and elevation category.\n\nFor the slope category:\n\n\nRight click on the 'edu_slope_elevation_model' layer > select Open Attribute Table > Open field calculator\n\n\n\nAt the Output field name, indicate: 'Slope Level'\nAt the Output field type, click on the drop down icon and indicate Text as the data type\nCopy and paste the following code into the expression input:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCASE\nWhen (“slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” >= 0 and  “slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” < 2.1) THEN ‘Low Slope’\nWhen (  “slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” >= 2.1 and  “slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” < 4.7) THEN ‘Low Slope’\nWhen (  “slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” >= 4.7) THEN ’Low Slope'\nEND\n\n\n\n\nClick on the OK button and a new field will be created.\n\nFor the elevation category:\n\nRepeat the same steps as the slope category\n\n\n\nChange the Output field name to 'Elevation'\nCopy and paste the following code into the expression input:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCASE\nWhen ( “elevation_raster_model”  >= 5 and   “elevation_raster_model”< 21) THEN ‘Low Elevation’\nWhen( “elevation_raster_model”  >= 21 and  “elevation_raster_model” < 52) THEN ‘Low Elevation’\nWhen ( “elevation_raster_model”  >= 52) THEN ‘Low Elevation’\nEND\n\n\n\nAfter creating both of the categories, we need to create a new category with both the elevation and slope category. This allows us to categorise the education centres according to which both slope and elevation at the same time.\n\nRepeat the same steps as the slope category\n\n\n\nChange the Output field name to 'Final Def'\nCopy and paste the following code into the expression input:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCASE\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Low Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Low Slope’) THEN ‘Low elevation/slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Low Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Mid Slope’) THEN ‘Low elevation, Mid slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Low Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘High Slope’) THEN ‘Low elevation, High slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Mid Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Low Slope’) THEN ‘Mid elevation, Low slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Mid Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Mid Slope’) THEN ‘Mid elevation/slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Mid Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘High Slope’) THEN ‘Mid elevation, High slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘High Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Low Slope’) THEN ‘High elevation, Low slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘High Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Mid Slope’) THEN ‘High elevation, Mid slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘High Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘High Slope’) THEN ‘High elevation/slope’\nWHEN \"Slope Level\" IS NULL THEN \"Elevation\"\nEND\n\n\n\nAfter creating the 3 new categories, we need to save these changes. On the top left of Attribute table window, click on the pencil icon and confirm the saved changes made.\n\n\n1.8 Creating A Derna City Layer That Excludes The Flooded Area\nWe need to create a new layer that excludes areas that are flooded. To do this we need both the flooded layer and derna city layer.\n\nSelect Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Symmetrical Differences…\nFor the input layer: Flood - s2_20230912_floodextent_derna\nOverlay layer: Derna_City\nFor both the layer, click on the Advanced options\nAt the Invalid feature filtering, click on the drop down and select 'Do not Filter (Better Performance', and click on the back button on the top left\n\n\n\nHere is how the dialog window should look like\n\n\n\nClick on the run button\nA new layer 'Symmetrical difference' will be created\nGeopackage this layer to save it. Remember to change the CRS projection to EPSG: 32634. For the file save it as 'low_flood_hex'"

    "text": "The following maps shows the accessibility of residential towns to evacuation centres and healthcare facilities. The maps also shows some potential education centres that can be used as a evacuation centres during a disaster.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Derna City’s Accessibility Before The Flood\n\n\nPrior to the flood, we observe a lack of accessibility of residential areas to emergency services and healthcare facilities. A substantial number of residential towns on the East and West of Derna City are entirely inaccessible to shelters. Moreover, majority of residential towns have access to shelters are situated more than 1km away. This suggests that during an emergency, most residents will have to evacuate to shelters that are more than 1 km away from them (as seen in dark red areas where two other residential towns are found from legend), which is not very ideal.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Derna City’s Accessibility After The Flood\n\n\nFollowing a flood, roads are blocked and damaged, leading to a drastic reduction in the accessibility of healthcare and emergency centres compared to Figure 1. There are now fewer highly accessible shelters as compared to Figure 1 (as seen from reduced white areas ). Since the only residential town that falls within the 900m is also within the flooded area, the shelters in that location may have been flooded as well. Hence, the nearest shelter outside the flooded area may be less accessible for the displaced residents there. Additionally, fewer residential towns are now within 2.5 km of a shelter compared to Figure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Buffer Area of Derna City Post Flood\n\n\nIn Figure 3, we observe the delineated buffer service area that the shelters can cover within a 1 km radius. The figure suggests that most of the residents affected by the flooded area are within the service area (as seen where the entire flooded area within the pink buffers). However, residential towns in the East and West of Derna City are not covered by the buffer service area, which suggests that these areas have less accessibility to a shelter. In the event where a more impactful flood strikes Derna City, the residential towns that are more than 2.5 km away and not within the service area of a shelter will become more vulnerable if they are flooded.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Potential Sites As Evacuation Centres\n\n\nWe analysed the elevation level and slope degree of potential sites to be used as emergency shelters during a flood event. Since we want to identify areas at risk of flooding and understand which parts of Derna City are most vulnerable, having a high elevation level and slope degree are key. Higher elevation level suggests that the area is less prone to flooding. Higher slope degree will generate more velocity than gentle slopes, which increases surface runoff and discourages ponding.\nAs our aim is to identify safe locations for emergency shelters and reduce the vulnerability of residents, we assigned greater importance to elevation levels over slope degrees. Low elevation areas, when combined with mid or high slope degrees, can serve as valuable sites for emergency shelters. Thus, we excluded areas with low slope degree from our potential sites selections. The potential sites that we chose are marked in pink, green, yellow, light blue and purple.\nThese sites are located in lower risk flood areas and are less vulnerable to flooding. This is compared to points within the flooded area that have low slope degree, the blue and orange points, which are more vulnerable and already susceptible to floods."
