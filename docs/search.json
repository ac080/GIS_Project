This is done by evaluating whether there are enough emergency facilities in populated areas and whether they are easily accessible."

    "text": "Libya has been facing a serious crisis of being plagued by flood disasters in recent years due to climate change. This had led to life threatening consequences of death and destruction in the country. For instance, the collapse of Derna dam in 2023 caused thousands of deaths and irreversible damage to infrastructure, devastating the country socially and economically. As a result, the government has decided to deploy mitigation measures to prepare for future disasters and assist in recovery and relief. \nThrough this project, we want to find out the current state of preparedness in Derna city by mapping out the accessibility to emergency centres and medical services to aid in disaster relief. We hope to be able to provide meaningful insights on mitigating urban flood disasters in Derna city so as to provide actionable suggestions for future disaster management planning."

We then clipped the raster layer to the size of Derna City and stretched it to current extent to obtain results of the most heavily flooded zones in our study area."
