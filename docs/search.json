Yet, insufficient measures are put in placed by the government to prevent it from occurring again.\nThis project aims to find out the accessibility of emergency and medical centres to people in order to improve Derna city’s level of preparedness and reduce rescue time. This is done by evaluating whether there are enough emergency facilities in populated areas and whether they are easily accessible."

    "text": "Libya has been facing severe urban flooding in recent years caused by climate change and political instability. This led to life threatening consequences of death and destruction in the country. For instance, the collapse of the Derna dam in 2023 caused thousands of deaths and irreversible damage to the infrastructures. This devastated the country socially and economically. As a result, the government decided to deploy some measures to prepare for future disasters and assist in recovery and relief.\nThrough this project, we aim to enhance Derna City’s preparedness and reducing its rescue time. This is done by mapping out the accessibility of residential areas to emergency centres and medical services. We hope to provide meaningful insights for minimising the impact of flood disasters on Derna City and propose recommendations for future disaster management planning."

    "text": "Derna City Hexagon Map\n\nAs the data obtained from open network sources includes the entire Libya map, we chose to use the hexagon map that only included Derna City from Derna City 250m Hexagon Map to narrow down to our study area.\n\n\nFlooding Extent Of Derna City\n\nIn order to compare with our land use layers, we extracted the raster layer of flooding extent in Libya and the elevation model from the Humanitarian Data Exchange portal. We then clipped the raster layer to the size of Derna City and stretched it to current extent to obtain results of the most heavily flooded zones in our study area.\n\n\nUse of ISO-Area To Show Accessibility\n\nTo understand the proximity between the shelters and residential areas, we decided to use ISO-Area. This allows for the creation of zones based on consistent travel distances from shelters, providing a clear spatial representation of accessibility.\nOur group feels that using distance as a measurement provides a more tangible and straightforward representation of the physical coverage area. Knowing the spatial extent covered by shelters in terms of distance is crucial for effective emergency planning, especially when considering the challenges posed by damaged infrastructure and roads.\nThis is in contrast to a time-based measurement, which may be inaccurate in a disaster. This is because roads may be damaged or destroyed and people may need to use alternative routes that may not rely on the conventional road network, which may lead to variations in travel time.\n\n\nIdentifying Potential Evacuation Centres\n\nWe identified potential shelters through the use of Point Sampling Tool plugin. This extracts the raster values (elevation and slope layer) at the specific centres, allowing us to categorise locations based on the ideal values.\nOur group also thought about using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which is a multi-criteria decision analysis method that helps in structuring and solving complex decision problems. We decided not to use the AHP as we had to assign weights to all the criteria and their relative importance. Unfortunately, due to limited research conducted by the Libyan government, we were not able to figure out which criteria holds a greater importance, leading us to exclude this method from our analysis."

Remember to change the CRS projection. Rename the layer to 'elevation model'\nBefore you move on to the next section, remember to remove the raw and temporary layers. \n\n\n\n1.2 Extracting Specific Features From Each Layer\n\nOpen the attribute table of the layer health_facilities by right clicking and selecting Open Attribute Table.\nFrom the menu bar of the attribute table, click on Select Features using an Expression icon.\nInside the expression box, select fields and values > amenity. Type in '=' and press All Unique in the value box on the right. Then double click on 'hospital', 'doctor', 'clinic' as these constitute the medical centres that we are trying to study.\n\nClick on the Select Features button.\nNow, we can save the features by Export > Save Selected Features As and create a new Geopackage layer. Remember to change all CRS projection to EPSG: 32634.\nNow, we can do the same for all the remaining layers. Eg. for the Hotosm_lby_buildings layer, we will only extract residential areas, as for the OSM buildings layer, we will extract emergency centres and medical facilities. \nYou can refer to the screenshots below on what to extract.\n\n\nAfter completing, we will save all the layers in Geopackage format.\n\n\n\n1.3 Merging Both Emergency and Medical Facilities, and Education Layer\nFirstly, we have to merge all the emergency centres and medical facilities layers obtained from several raw layers, mainly the OSM and HotOSM layers. Secondly, we have to merge the OSM and HotOSM layers of the Education layer together.\n\nFrom the menu bar, select Vector > Data Management Tools > Merge Vector Layers.\n\n\n\nFor input layers, check all the emergency centres and medical facilities.\n\nClick OK.\nChange the CRS projection to EPSG: 32634.\nClick Run like the screenshot below.\n\n\nA new temporary merged layer is created and it needs to be saved into a GeoPackage.\n\nWe can save the features by Export > Save Selected Features As and create a new Geopackage layer.

Remember to change the CRS projection to EPSG: 32634. For the file save it as 'emergency_healthcare_centroid'\n\n\n\n1.5 Creating Slope Layer\nWe will compute a slope layer from elevation model layer layer by using the Slope operation.\n\nFrom the menu bar, select Raster  Analysis  Slope.\n\nSlope dialog window appears.\n\nFor Input layer, select elevation model layer from the drop-down list.\n\nKeep the rest of the setting as default.\n\nClick on the Run button.\n\nWhen the computation is completed, a temporary layer called Slope will be added. Click on Close button to close Slope function dialog window.\nIn order to save the newly computed Slope layer, we need to GeoPackage it.\nRight click on the Slope layer click on Export select Save As…\n·  Make sure that the format is Geopackage and select the Browse button at the File Name\n·  When inside the Geopackage file, create a new 'Slope' file and click on the save button\n·  At the Layer input, indicate \"Slope\"\n·  At the CRS, click on the drop-down button and click on EPSG: 32634\n\nRemove the temporary Slope layer by doing the steps mentioned above.\n\n\n\n1.6 Adding Elevation and Slope level to Education Layer\nFirstly, we need to download a plugin. At the menu bar, select Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins…\n\nAt the search tab, search for 'Point sampling tool' and click on it\nAt the bottom right, click on Install Plugin\n\nAfter the plugin is installed, close the dialog window\n\n\nEnsure that only the education layer and slope raster layer are selected in the layers panel.\n\nSelect Plugins > Analyses > Point Sampling Tool\nIn the 'Layers with fields/bands to get values from:', scroll down till you see the slope raster layer\nClick on it\nAt the 'Output point vector layer', select on the Browse button\nHead to the GeoPackage folder and name the new file as 'Slope_education''\n\n\n\nA new point layer will be created\n\n\n\nRepeat the same process to integrate the slope degree into the point layer. Instead of using the education layer and elevation raster layer, use the Slope_education and elevation level layer. Name the new layer 'edu_slope_elevation_model'. After this, remove the Slope_education layer.\n\n\n1.7 Creating Slope and Elevation Category Field\nTo make it easier to visualise which education location is most optimal, we will be creating a 'Low', 'Mid' and 'High' category for both the slope and elevation category.\n\nFor the slope category:\n\n\nRight click on the 'edu_slope_elevation_model' layer > select Open Attribute Table > Open field calculator\n\n\n\nAt the Output field name, indicate: 'Slope Level'\nAt the Output field type, click on the drop down icon and indicate Text as the data type\nCopy and paste the following code into the expression input:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCASE\nWhen (“slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” >= 0 and  “slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” < 2.1) THEN ‘Low Slope’\nWhen (  “slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” >= 2.1 and  “slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” < 4.7) THEN ‘Low Slope’\nWhen (  “slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” >= 4.7) THEN ’Low Slope'\nEND\n\n\n\n\nClick on the OK button and a new field will be created.\n\nFor the elevation category:\n\nRepeat the same steps as the slope category\n\n\n\nChange the Output field name to 'Elevation'\nCopy and paste the following code into the expression input:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCASE\nWhen ( “elevation_raster_model”  >= 5 and   “elevation_raster_model”< 21) THEN ‘Low Elevation’\nWhen( “elevation_raster_model”  >= 21 and  “elevation_raster_model” < 52) THEN ‘Low Elevation’\nWhen ( “elevation_raster_model”  >= 52) THEN ‘Low Elevation’\nEND\n\n\n\nAfter creating both of the categories, we need to create a new category with both the elevation and slope category. This allows us to categorise the education centres according to which both slope and elevation at the same time.\n\nRepeat the same steps as the slope category\n\n\n\nChange the Output field name to 'Final Def'\nCopy and paste the following code into the expression input:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCASE\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Low Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Low Slope’) THEN ‘Low elevation/slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Low Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Mid Slope’) THEN ‘Low elevation, Mid slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Low Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘High Slope’) THEN ‘Low elevation, High slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Mid Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Low Slope’) THEN ‘Mid elevation, Low slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Mid Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Mid Slope’) THEN ‘Mid elevation/slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Mid Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘High Slope’) THEN ‘Mid elevation, High slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘High Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Low Slope’) THEN ‘High elevation, Low slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘High Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Mid Slope’) THEN ‘High elevation, Mid slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘High Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘High Slope’) THEN ‘High elevation/slope’\nWHEN \"Slope Level\" IS NULL THEN \"Elevation\"\nEND\n\n\n\nAfter creating the 3 new categories, we need to save these changes. On the top left of Attribute table window, click on the pencil icon and confirm the saved changes made.\n\n\n1.8 Creating A Derna City Layer That Excludes The Flooded Area\nWe need to create a new layer that excludes areas that are flooded. To do this we need both the flooded layer and derna city layer.\n\nSelect Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Symmetrical Differences…\nFor the input layer: Flood - s2_20230912_floodextent_derna\nOverlay layer: Derna_City\nFor both the layer, click on the Advanced options\nAt the Invalid feature filtering, click on the drop down and select 'Do not Filter (Better Performance', and click on the back button on the top left\n\n\n\nHere is how the dialog window should look like\n\n\n\nClick on the run button\nA new layer 'Symmetrical difference' will be created\nGeopackage this layer to save it. Remember to change the CRS projection to EPSG: 32634. For the file save it as 'low_flood_hex'"

At the menu bar, select Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins…\n\nAt the search tab, search for ‘Point sampling tool’ and click on it\nAt the bottom right, click on Install Plugin\n\nAfter the plugin is installed, close the dialog window\n\nEnsure that only the education layer and slope raster layer are selected in the layers panel.\n\nSelect Plugins > Analyses > Point Sampling Tool\nIn the ‘Layers with fields/bands to get values from:’, scroll down till you see the slope raster layer\nClick on it\nAt the ‘Output point vector layer’, select on the Browse button\nHead to the GeoPackage folder and name the new file as ‘Slope_education’\n\n\n\nA new point layer will be created\n\nRepeat the same process to integrate the slope degree into the point layer. Instead of using the education layer and elevation raster layer, use the Slope_education and elevation level layer. Name the new layer ‘edu_slope_elevation_model’. After this, remove the Slope_education layer.\n\n\n1.7 Creating Slope and Elevation Category Field\nTo make it easier to visualise which education location is most optimal, we will be creating a ‘Low’, ‘Mid’ and ‘High’ category for both the slope and elevation category.\n\nFor the slope category:\n\n\nRight click on the ‘edu_slope_elevation_model’ layer > select Open Attribute Table > Open field calculator\n\n\n\nAt the Output field name, indicate: ‘Slope Level’\nAt the Output field type, click on the drop down icon and indicate Text as the data type\nCopy and paste the following code into the expression input:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCASE\nWhen (“slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” >= 0 and  “slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” < 2.1) THEN ‘Low Slope’\nWhen (  “slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” >= 2.1 and  “slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” < 4.7) THEN ‘Low Slope’\nWhen (  “slope_edu_final.gpkg_Slope” >= 4.7) THEN ‘Low Slope’\nEND\n\n\n\n\nClick on the OK button and a new field will be created.\n\nFor the elevation category:\n\nRepeat the same steps as the slope category\n\n\n\nChange the Output field name to ‘Elevation’\nCopy and paste the following code into the expression input:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCASE\nWhen ( “elevation_raster_model”  >= 5 and   “elevation_raster_model”< 21) THEN ‘Low Elevation’\nWhen( “elevation_raster_model”  >= 21 and  “elevation_raster_model” < 52) THEN ‘Low Elevation’\nWhen ( “elevation_raster_model”  >= 52) THEN ‘Low Elevation’\nEND\n\n\n\nAfter creating both of the categories, we need to create a new category with both the elevation and slope category. This allows us to categorise the education centres according to which both slope and elevation at the same time.\n\nRepeat the same steps as the slope category\n\n\n\nChange the Output field name to ‘Final Def’\nCopy and paste the following code into the expression input:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCASE\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Low Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Low Slope’) THEN ‘Low elevation/slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Low Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Mid Slope’) THEN ‘Low elevation, Mid slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Low Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘High Slope’) THEN ‘Low elevation, High slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Mid Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Low Slope’) THEN ‘Mid elevation, Low slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Mid Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Mid Slope’) THEN ‘Mid elevation/slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘Mid Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘High Slope’) THEN ‘Mid elevation, High slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘High Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Low Slope’) THEN ‘High elevation, Low slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘High Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘Mid Slope’) THEN ‘High elevation, Mid slope’\nWHEN  (“Elevation” =  ‘High Elevation’ and  “Slope Level” = ‘High Slope’) THEN ‘High elevation/slope’\nWHEN “Slope Level” IS NULL THEN “Elevation”\nEND\n\n\n\nAfter creating the 3 new categories, we need to save these changes. On the top left of Attribute table window, click on the pencil icon and confirm the saved changes made.\n\n\n1.8 Creating A Derna City Layer That Excludes The Flooded Area\nWe need to create a new layer that excludes areas that are flooded. To do this we need both the flooded layer and derna city layer.\n\nSelect Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Symmetrical Differences…\nFor the input layer: Flood - s2_20230912_floodextent_derna\nOverlay layer: Derna_City\nFor both the layer, click on the Advanced options\nAt the Invalid feature filtering, click on the drop down and select ‘Do not Filter (Better Performance’, and click on the back button on the top left\n\n\n\nHere is how the dialog window should look like\n\n\n\nClick on the run button\nA new layer ‘Symmetrical difference’ will be created\nGeopackage this layer to save it. Remember to change the CRS projection to EPSG: 32634. For the file save it as ‘low_flood_hex’"

    "text": "Moreover, the current flooding situation is aggravated because many existing shelters are within the flooded area, restricting access. This means that if these shelters are flooded, it reduces the number of evacuation options for residents within the flooded area. Additionally, it will increase the time taken for residents to reach a safety area. Therefore, the need to have additional emergency shelters to mitigate potential disasters in the future is essential.\nIn the long term, we have a few recommendations to better prepare Derna City for future flood disasters. Firstly, it is recommended for the government to increase the quantity of emergency centres. It would be advisable to construct these centres at locations with elevated and slope terrain, with a preference for higher elevation and ensuring accessibility to major residential areas. This is essential in minimising vulnerability during unprecedented flood events when access to emergency services is limited. In general, it will allow for greater capacity, which means more displaced people will have a temporary home. It will also help to distribute human flow better as people have more options on which shelter to go to.\nSecondly, on top of building centres at places with elevated and slope terrain, it is crucial to ensure that these locations are accessible to food and drinkable water. This is to ensure that residents are able to survive at these centres until they are able to move back to their homes.\nThirdly, the adoption of advanced technologies is crucial. Implementing predictive technologies for disaster events will enhance residents’ preparedness. Additionally, investing in robust warning systems will significantly reduce vulnerability. People will have ample time to evacuate their houses and move to a shelter, reducing deaths, injuries and likelihood of overcrowding at the same few shelters. Flood prediction systems can also be explored to predict the magnitude of the incoming flood and inform people on which shelters they should go to."

    "text": "The following maps shows the accessibility of residential towns to evacuation centres and healthcare facilities. The maps also shows some potential education centres that can be used as evacuation centres during a disaster.\n\n\n\nThe map shows that majority of the health care facilities are within the flooded area. This indicates that these facilities could be at a risk of flooding in the event of a more severe flood, which would require residents living in the flood to travel to more distant shelters. Additionally, there are much fewer road network within the flooded area, which reduces the accessibility between residents and evacuation centres.\n\n\n\n\nThis map shows the aftermath of the flood, where the roads are damaged and blocked, which cannot be used. It also shows the flood had caused a lot of damage to the infrastructures, where the flood swept the buildings into the sea, polluting it. Furthermore, the primary highway in Derna City was damaged from the flood, which is the only major road that runs along the entire east-west length, significantly diminishing overall accessibility.\n\n\n\n\nThe recent flooding event caused roads to be blocked and damaged, causing a significant reduction in the accessibility of shelters. There are now fewer highly accessible shelters. Additionally, residents who are displaced from the flood have to travel more than 1km to access shelters outside of the flooded area if the shelters in the flooded area are not usable. The blocked roads also resulted in fewer residential towns to fall within 2.5 km of a shelter.\n\n\n\n\nWe mapped out the accessibility of existing and education sites that have high elevation/slope. This significantly increased the accessibility of residential towns to shelters, where majority of residents are able to access a shelter. Moreover, it offers residents with more evacuation options, ensuring that if a shelter is overcrowded, residents are still able to move to another nearby shelter. It can be see that there are many more shelters available outside of the flooded area, allowing residents to safely evacuate from the flood."

    "text": "Derna is a coastal city located at the edge of Libya, which is a Mediterranean country located in the tropics. Thus, it is more vulnerable to strong winds that bring about tropical storms and floods. Since 2023 is an El Niño year, surging temperatures had warmed up the ocean, fueling a tropical storm named Storm Daniel, the deadly storm that had resulted in the flood. Moreover, anthropogenic factors also had a hand in the tragedy. Despite warnings to repair and maintain the two dams at Wadi Derna that had cracks and fissures the authorities had ignored the warnings. Thus, when Storm Daniel occured, the unprecedented intensity of the storm had caused both dams to fail and collapse.\nWe could explore the ‘zoning’ strategy, where we categorise each area / residential town in Derna and create a road network analysis that determines which emergency centres and healthcare facilities are nearest to them. This creates a more systematic approach in evacuation planning, where people are more likely to evacuate to the places they are assigned to, reducing panic and confusion amongst people. This also helps to keep track of the capacity of each facility, reducing the chance of overcrowding. The people of Derna city can be educated of this strategy by informing them a list of locations they could seek shelter. With warning and prediction systems in place, residents will be able to gauge which is the best location for them to head to before or during a flooding event.\nIn the future, we could explore using the shortest path QGIS method to analyse the possible paths that residents or rescuers can take to address food and water shortage during emergencies. This method will help to reduce time taken for the residents to access basic necessities while waiting to relocate to a safer place, reducing their vulnerability to starvation, dehydration and illnesses."

    "text": "Derna City’s Accessibility During a Flood (With Residential Town)\n\nAccessibility of Shelters Before a Flood\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Accessibility of Shelters Before a Flood\n\n\nPrior to the flood, we observe a lack of accessibility of residential areas to emergency services and healthcare facilities. A substantial number of residential towns on the East and West of Derna City are entirely inaccessible to shelters. Moreover, majority of residential towns that have access to shelters are situated more than 1km away. This suggests that during an emergency, most residents will have to evacuate to shelters that are more than 1 km away from them (as seen in dark red areas where two other residential towns are found from legend), which is not very ideal.\n\n\nAccessibility of Shelters After a Flood\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Accessibility of Shelters After The Flood\n\n\nFollowing a flood, roads are blocked and damaged, leading to a drastic reduction in the accessibility of healthcare and emergency centres compared to Figure 1. There are now fewer highly accessible shelters as compared to Figure 1 (as seen from reduced white areas ). Since the only residential town that falls within the 900m is also within the flooded area, the shelters in that location may have been flooded as well. Furthermore, residents who are displaced from the flood have to travel more than 1km to access shelters outside of the flooded area. The blocked roads also resulted in fewer residential towns to fall within 2.5 km of a shelter compared to Figure 1.\n\n\nBuffer Service Area of Shelters After a Flood\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Buffer Service Area of Shelters After Flood\n\n\nIn Figure 3, we observe the delineated buffer service area that the shelters can cover within a 1 km radius. The figure suggests that most of the residents affected by the flooded area are within the service area (as seen where the entire flooded area within the pink buffers). However, residential towns in the East and West of Derna City are not covered by the buffer service area, which suggests that these areas have less accessibility to a shelter. In the event where a more impactful flood strikes Derna City, the residential towns that are more than 2.5 km away and not within the service area of a shelter will become more vulnerable if they are flooded.\n\n\nPotential Sites As Evacuation Centres\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Potential Sites As Evacuation Centres\n\n\nWe analysed the elevation level and slope degree of potential sites to be used as emergency shelters during a flood event. Since we want to identify areas at risk of flooding and understand which parts of Derna City are most vulnerable, having a high elevation level and slope degree are key. Higher elevation level suggests that the area is less prone to flooding. Higher slope degree will generate more velocity than gentle slopes, which increases surface runoff and discourages ponding.\nAs our aim is to identify safe locations for emergency shelters and reduce the vulnerability of residents, we assigned greater importance to elevation levels over slope degrees. Low elevation areas, when combined with mid or high slope degrees, can serve as valuable sites for emergency shelters. Thus, we excluded areas with low slope degree from our potential sites selections. The potential sites that we chose are marked in pink, green, yellow, light blue and purple.\nThese sites are located in lower risk flood areas and are less vulnerable to flooding. This is compared to points within the flooded area that have low slope degree, the blue and orange points, which are more vulnerable and already susceptible to floods.\n\n\nAccessibility With Existing and Potential Shelters\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Accessibility With Existing and Potential Shelters\n\n\nIn Figure 5, we added the potential sites that could be used as emergency shelters along with the existing ones to create a new accessibility map. There are now more and larger white areas which suggests increased accessibility, and there are multiple of such areas outside of the flooded area (as seen from white areas outside blue dashed lines in legend).\nThis expanded accessibility fosters greater mobility for displaced residents within the flooded area, allowing them to reach alternative shelters. Some parts of the residential towns in the East and West of Derna City also fall within the white areas now, where they previously were in the furthest dark green areas of 2.1 km to 2.5km in Figure 1, and not covered in Figure 2.\nThe majority of residential areas now have improved access to shelters, resulting in a notable reduction in the vulnerability of these towns during emergency situations.\n\n\nBuffer Service Area of Shelters With Potential Sites\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Buffer Service Area of Shelters With Potential Sites\n\n\nLike Figure 3, we observe the delineated buffer service area that the shelters can cover within a 1 km radius. The figure suggests that most of the residents affected by the flooded area are within the service area (as seen from legend where the entire flooded area is found within the orange buffers).\nHowever, the new buffer service area covers a larger extent as compared to Figure 3, where residential towns in the East of Derna City are now covered by the buffer service area. This suggests that these areas have greater accessibility to a shelter. In an emergency, these residential towns will become less vulnerable to flooding impacts as they are within both the service area and 2.5 km from a shelter.\n\n\nExtended Accessibility of Potential Sites\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Extended Accessibility of Potential Shelters\n\n\nWe observe the expanded area of accessibility to emergency shelters for residential towns if the potential sites are utilised. We can note that there is an expansion in all directions of Derna City, incorporating residential towns that were previously not covered. The majority of residential towns are now covered, with the exception of a small part in the West.\nFurthermore, there is an increase in highly accessible areas, as seen from legend where there are new white areas in the West and North of Derna City. Overall, most areas are within 2.5 km of a shelter, which reduces the vulnerability of residential areas during a flood, as individuals can access shelter more promptly."

    "text": "Climate and Infrastructure Issues\nThe Libyan government has been plagued with political instability as different states are ruled by opposing parties. Derna City is ruled by the rebel coalition, which is not recognised by the international community. This made it difficult to receive aids. Moreover, due to political tension, the government did not bother repairing the dams despite experts warning them about it. This had led to the Derna dam collapse, resulting in one of the worst flooding in Africa.\nEastern Libya is situated in a low lying area and have weak infrastructure. Derna City is also located at the bottom of very steep mountains. Additionally, the soil was very dry and cracked after the summer, which was not equipped to absorb large amounts of water. This made it very susceptible to disaster as prolonged rainfall can cause flooding.\nThe recent Storm Daniel has led to the collapse of both dams, which have not been properly maintained in decades. The roads and bridges in Derna City were also not built to be resilient against such disasters. The miscommunication and poor planning of pre and post disaster led to the death of at least 5,000 people, with another 6,000 missing and about half the city’s total population of 90,000 displaced from their homes."
