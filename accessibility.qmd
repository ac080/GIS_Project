### **1. CREATING ACCESSIBILITY MAPS USING QNEAT3 PLUGIN**

-   From the menu bar, go to **Processing -\> Toolbox**

\
![](images/iso_toolbox.png)

-   A dialogue box pops up.

-   Type \'Iso Areas as Polygons (From Layer)\' and select it. 

\
![](images/access1_iso.png){width="345"}

-   For Vector layer representing network, select the road layer that is unblocked (before flood) roads_derna_final

-   For Start points, select evacuation_shelters_before_flood

![](images/access1_isowindow.png)

-   For Direction field, select oneway

-   For Value for Forward direction, type in \'F\'

-   For Value for Backward direction, type in \'T\'

-   For Value for Both directions, type in \'B\'

-   Leave the rest of the fields Default.

-   Click Run.

![](images/iso_window.png)

-   A new temporary Output polygon layer will be created in the layer panel.

-   In order to save the new layer, we need to GeoPackage the layer

-   We can save the features by **Export \> Save Selected Features As** and create a new Geopackage layer. Remember to change the CRS projection to EPSG: 32634. For the file save it as \'Accessibility_before_flood\'.

![](images/acess1_map_before.png)

-   Now we have to categorise the iso areas by distance.

-   Right click on the layer and go to Properties.

-   Select the Symbology Tab. Change to Graduated symbol, and the value to Cost Level. Change the mode to \'Natural Breaks (Jenks)\', where the class breaks are created in a way that best groups similar values together, therefore maximising the differences between classes for more distinct visualisation. Click on Classify and select OK to close.

-   This should be the result.

![](images/result_before_flood.png)

-   Repeat the steps to create a map for Accessibility_of_unblocked_roads. The road layer to be used will now be \'remaining_acc_roads\' (which are roads that are unblocked post flood) and start points will still remain the same.

\

-   To obtain the layer on unblocked roads post flood, we have to manually remove the blocked roads from what we have researched.

-   To do so, click on the roads layer to make it active, and select \'select features by area\' or single click from the toolbar.

-   Manually select the roads to remove.

![](images/access1_road.png)

-   Save these selected features into Geopackage, name it as \'impassable_roads\'.

-   To get the remaining roads, we can use the difference function.

-    From the menu bar, go to **Vector -\> Geoprocessing tools -\> Difference**

![](images/acess_21_diff_path.png)

-   A dialogue box pops up.

-   For the input layer, select \'roads_network\'.

-   For the overlay layer, select \'impassable_roads\'.

-   Leave the rest of the fields as default.

-   Click Run.

![](images/diff_window.png)

-   A temporary difference layer will be created with the remaining roads.

-   Export and save the layer as geopackage. Rename it as \'remaining_acc_roads\'.

\

### **2.0 CREATING BUFFER SERVICE AREA**

-   From the menu bar, go to **Vector -\> Geoprocessing tools -\> Buffer**

![](images/buffer_path.png){width="559"}\
\

-   A dialogue box pops up.

-   For the input layer, select \'evacuation_shelters_before flood\'.

-   Leave the rest of the fields as default.

-   Click Run.

![](images/access_20_buffer.png)

-   A new temporary buffer layer will be created.

-   Save it as a geopackage layer and rename it as \'buffer_area_evac_centre\'

-   Go to the symbology tab and lower the opacity to 50% so that it will not block the view of the accessibility maps.

### **2.1 MERGING POTENTIAL AND EXISTING SITES TO ANALYSE FUTURE MEASURES** 

-   Right click on \'edu_slope_elevation_model\' and go to the attribute table.

-   From the menu bar of the attribute table, click on Select Features using an Expression  icon.

-   Inside the expression box, go to \'Fields and Values\' and double click on \'Final def\'.

-   Click on \'=\' sign and select \'High elevation, Mid slope\' found on the all values dialogue box.

-   Exclude all values with low slope/low elevation.

-   Follow the screenshot below on which values to select. 

-   Click on the select features button.

![](images/access_21_expression.png)

-   Again, save these selected features into Geopackage, name it as \'edu_potential_sites\'.

-   Now we will merge it with the existing facilities.

-    From the menu bar, go to **Vector -\> Geoprocessing tools -\> Union**

![](images/access_21_union_path.png)

#  ![](images/union_final.png)

-   A dialogue box pops up.

-   For the input layer, select \'edu_potential_sites\'.

-   For the overlay layer, select \'evacuation_shelters_before_flood\'.

-   Leave the rest of the fields as default.

-   Click Run.

-   A new temporary union layer will be created.

-   Save it as a geopackage layer and rename it as \'edu_healthcare_facilities - union\'.

-   With the new layer, refer to above on how to create an iso area using QNEAT3 and buffer service area.

-   Rename the layers as \'accessbility_unblocked_roads_future\' and \'buffer_area_w\_potential_sites\'.

### **2.1 MEASURING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POTENTIAL AND EXISTING SERVICE AREAS**

-    From the menu bar, go to **Vector -\> Geoprocessing tools -\> Difference**

![](images/acess_21_diff_path.png)

-   A dialogue box pops up.

-   For the input layer, select \'accessbility_unblocked_roads_future\'.

-   For the overlay layer, select \'accessbility_of_unblocked_roads\'.

-   Leave the rest of the fields as default.

-   Click Run.

![](images/access_21_create.png)

-   A new temporary difference layer will be created.

-   Save it as a geopackage layer and rename it as \'expanded_potential_sites - difference\'.
