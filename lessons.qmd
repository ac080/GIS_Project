## Conclusion

In conclusion, the current accessibility of emergency centres and healthcare facilities in Derna City is limited. Although residential towns on the Eastern and Western edges of Derna City experience low accessibility, their exposure to flooding impact is minimal as these areas are situated outside of the flood-prone zones and have higher elevation/slope levels.

Since most residential towns are located within these areas, it can be suggested that most of Derna City's residents are at a lower risk during such flooding events. However, with the worsening floods in Libya coupled with the lack of shelters, these areas will become increasingly vulnerable over time.

In the long term, it is recommended for the government to increase the quantity of emergency centres. It would be advisable to construct these centres in locations with elevated and slope terrain, with a preference for higher elevation, and ensuring accessibility to major residential areas. This is essential in minimising vulnerability during unprecedented flood events when access to emergency services is limited.

## Considerations

The decision making process for the Libyan government depends on its priorities. Given financial constraints and political debates, the government must decide which is more important in light of the worsening flooding conditions:

a\) Implement more mitigation measures in higher flooding risk areas

b\) Implement more preventive measures in lower flooding risk areas

This is crucial to continue protecting residents who are currently not affected by the flood. Additionally, it ensure that residents who were displaced by the flood have better infrastructure to prevent it from occurring again.

Currently, there are residential towns and healthcare facilities that fall within the flooding extent. Hence, it is essential to relocate residents affected by the flood and repair the damaged infrastructure first. There could also be more underlying implications which we are unable to observe directly from the visual differences between the maps.

## Future Work

Some possibilities can be explored based on our analysis:Â 

-   Building more evacuation centres in areas that are highly accessible to residents so that they are able to reach the area in case of emergencies.

-   Look at how the infrastructure can be improved to prevent the same area from getting flooded each time (post flood analysis, accumulate historical flood event data)

-   Real time analysis to show / warn people of potential flooding so that they are able to head to evacuation centres first.

-   Identify better transportation routes that are less prone to flooding / getting blocked during flooding.

-   Predict potential flooding patterns based on multiple factors such as sources of flood, (flash flood, river flood) and other infrastructure (rate of drainage system overflowing). This will ensure that residents will avoid those areas during a flooding event to prevent deaths and injuries.
