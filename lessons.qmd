## Considerations

The decision making process for the Libyan government depends on its priorities. Given financial constraints and political debates, the government must decide which is more important in light of the worsening flooding conditions:

a\) Implement more mitigation measures in higher flooding risk areas

b\) Implement more preventive measures in lower flooding risk areas

This is crucial to continue protecting residents who are currently not affected by the flood. Additionally, it ensure that residents who were displaced by the flood have better infrastructure to prevent it from occurring again.

Currently, there are residential towns and healthcare facilities that fall within the flooding extent. Hence, it is essential to relocate residents affected by the flood and repair the damaged infrastructure first. There could also be more underlying implications which we are unable to observe directly from the visual differences between the maps.

## Future Work

Some possibilities can be explored based on our analysis:Â 

-   Building more evacuation centres in areas that are highly accessible to residents so that they are able to reach the area in case of emergencies.

-   Look at how the infrastructure can be improved to prevent the same area from getting flooded each time (post flood analysis, accumulate historical flood event data)

-   Only identify potential sites that have access to drinkable water and food so that residents can sustain themselves during an emergency

-   Real time analysis to show / warn people of potential flooding so that they are able to head to evacuation centres first.

-   Identify better transportation routes that are less prone to flooding / getting blocked during flooding.

-   Predict potential flooding patterns based on multiple factors such as sources of flood, (flash flood, river flood) and other infrastructure (rate of drainage system overflowing). This will ensure that residents will avoid those areas during a flooding event to prevent deaths and injuries.
